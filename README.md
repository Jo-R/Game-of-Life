# Conway's Game of Life

Per this article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

We use React at work but I haven't written much JS in the last few years so I wanted to do a mini-project in vanilla JS (and CSS/HTML) and I've wanted to implement this for a while.

Some inspiration from Lea Verou's walk through of this problem on Pluralsight, for example used her method of using reduce to sum the neighbour cells. I did write my js without referencing back to hers apart from that one method though!
