# Conway's Game of Life

We use React at work but I haven't written much JS in the last few years so I wanted to do a mini-project in vanilla JS (and CSS/HTML) and I've wanted to implement this for a while.

Some inspiration and guidance (especially around manipulating the DOM and the idea to use checkboxes) from Lea Verou's walk through of this problem on Pluralsight but I'm using ES6 modules and classes rather than IIFEs.
